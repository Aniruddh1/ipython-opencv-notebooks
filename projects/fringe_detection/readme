Jin's email:

Tom,

We have multiple fringe images generated from MR-alpha tool.
Images are with no-chrome replica, which may not provide sufficient reflection for well leveled plates
Machining-surface of the replica chuck is also confusing the image.

When replica is coated with a thin Chrome, it will significantly reduce the machining surface images.

NR2 tool will have antireflection coating for this area.

Please read what Chris explained below.

You may start with what I separately attached here.

Regards,

Jin

Jin,

Andy, Jeff and I made our first attempt to capture fringe images from the MR tool this afternoon.  A rigid master loaded on Zhead.  (No Chrome)  A replica blank loaded on replica chuck (No Chrome)

We first adjusted zhead position until we could clearly see fringes.  The nominal replica backpressure was 0. (Vented)  The nominal Y slope of Zhead was -0.007 (units?  uRad?)

Once the zhead position was set, we then adjusted replica backpressure to attempt to remove the circular signature observed to minimize the number of fringes across the field.  We then adjusted the Y slope of the Zhead to better center the fringes on the field which appeared to be aggregated at the bottom of the field at first.

Please review and let us know if this is good enough.
