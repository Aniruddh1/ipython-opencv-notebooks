# ipython-opencv-notebooks

This project contains some ipython notebooks and some test images I used while learning OpenCV image processing.  The notebooks
will run under Python 2.7.x, with the normal SciPy modules added (numpy, matplotlib, etc), plus OpenCV 3.x.  I created a
Docker image (see https://github.com/trafferty/docker-ipython-opencv) which has everything you need, but it is not necessary if you 
have all the correct modules installed (however, you should at least take a look at the docker file to see a full list of
dependencies, plus the compile settings I used for OpenCV).
