    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "Your first exercise is a somewhat silly one. I'd like you to compare date strings, but allow invalid dates while comparing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you read all the way to the end of this email, because I've linked to some automated tests to help you ensure you've solved this exercise correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want you to write a function that takes two strings representing dates and returns the string that represents the earliest point in time. The strings are in the US-specific MM/DD/YYYY format... just to make things harder. Note that the month, year, and day will always be represented by 2, 4, and 2 digits respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should work like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` <python>\n",
    ">>> get_earliest(\"01/27/1832\", \"01/27/1756\")\n",
    "\"01/27/1756\"\n",
    ">>> get_earliest(\"02/29/1972\", \"12/21/1946\")\n",
    "\"12/21/1946\"\n",
    ">>> get_earliest(\"02/24/1946\", \"03/21/1946\")\n",
    "\"02/24/1946\"\n",
    ">>> get_earliest(\"06/21/1958\", \"06/24/1958\")\n",
    "\"06/21/1958\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "There's a catch though. Your exercise should work with invalid month and date combinations. What I mean by that is that dates like 02/40/2006 should be supported. By that I mean 02/40/2006 is before 03/01/2006 but after 02/30/2006 (dates don't rollover at all). I'm adding this requirement so you can't rely on Python's datetime module.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to solve this one. See if you can figure out the clearest and most idiomatic way to solve this exercise. ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "If you complete the main exercise, there's also a bonus for you to attempt: allow the function to accept any number of arguments and return the earliest date string of all provided. ✔️\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you complete the bonus, this should work:\n",
    "``` <python>\n",
    ">>> get_earliest(\"02/24/1946\", \"01/29/1946\", \"03/29/1945\")\n",
    "\"03/29/1945\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "I've written some tests to make it easier to ensure your code functions as expected. You can download the test file here. You'll need to write your function in a file named earliest.py next to where you've saved that test file. To run the tests you'll run \"python test_earliest.py\" and check the output for \"OK\". You'll see that there are some \"expected failures\" (or \"unexpected successes\" maybe). If you'd like to do the bonus, you'll want to comment out a line to test them properly. You'll see that noted in the test file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll receive some answers and links to resources explaining ways to solve this exercise within a few days. Don't peek at the answers before attempting to solve this on your own.\n"

    "        for row1, row2 in zip(matrix1, matrix2)\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that this works because you can deeply compare lists in Python. We're calculating the length of each of the inner lists and asserting that the outer lists have the same length and that the inner lists all have the same length... all in a single if statement!\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to do this with any number of matrices, we'd need to somehow check for equality on many different lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use tuples instead of lists, we could use a set for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` <python>\n",
    "def add(*matrices):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Add corresponding numbers in given 2-D matrices.\"\"\"\n",
    "    matrix_shapes = {\n",
    "        tuple(len(r) for r in matrix)\n",

    "        for rows in zip(*matrices)\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This might seem a little complex. We're using a set here because set items are unique so if we pass in objects that are equal, we should only end up with 1 item in our set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't pass in a list because lists aren't \"hashable\" because they're mutable (they can be changed). Tuples can be hashable so we're passing a generator expression into the tuple constructor inside a set comprehension to make a set of tuples.\n",

    "Here's another answer:\n",

    "        ]\n",
    "    except TypeError as e:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Given matrices are not the same size.\") from e\n",
    "```\n",
    "This one is somewhat clever and may not be the clearest answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in zip function stops at the shortest list when zipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zip_longest function in the itertools module uses a fill value to return missing items so the resulting list is as long as the longest gives list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default fill value for zip_longest is None, so looping over None would fail and adding None to a number would fail too. In both cases we'd get a TypeError which is why we're catching a TypeError to handle the case where matrices aren't the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "That \"raise X from Y\" syntax we're using is a Python 3 feature to make tracebacks more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at one more answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` <python>\n",
