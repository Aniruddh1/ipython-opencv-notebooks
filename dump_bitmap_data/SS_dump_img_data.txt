1. Exit XFD.  This will also shutdown ScorpionServer process.

2. Open c:\workspace\ScorpionServer_config.json in an editor

3. In the section "XaarCmdAPI", change the field "dump_image_data" from false to true.  Save file.

4. Restart XFD.

5. Run a normal dispense.  In the workspace folder, there should be one or more files containing the raw bitmap data for the dispense.  The files should be named something like:

   "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_BitMap_x.dat"

   where "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS" is the date-timestamp and
         "x" is a serial number starting with 1.

   Example:

    Dumping image data to file: 20161020-222526_BitMap_1.dat

 If the drop pattern is a single-pass dispense, then you should see one .dat file.  If it is a dual-pass dispense then you should see two .dat files.  Note that as long as the "dump_image_data" field is set to true, these files will continue to accumulate.

6. When testing is complete, change the field "dump_image_data" from true back to false (see step 3).  Save file.


Testing:
g4x4 -> number 1
